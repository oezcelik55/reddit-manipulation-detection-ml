Reddit Financial Communities: Engagement Prediction & Hype Manipulation AnalysisThis project focuses on predicting user engagement and detecting "hype" (artificial or manipulative interest) within Reddit’s financial communities (such as r/wallstreetbets). By analyzing a dataset of over 230,000 posts, the study identifies patterns that distinguish organic investor interest from coordinated manipulation using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.🚀 Project OverviewIn online investment hubs, misinformation and artificial hype pose significant risks to rational investors. This project aims to:Predict Engagement: Estimate the success of a post (score and comment count) based on timing, content, and metadata.Detect Hype: Differentiate between genuine investor enthusiasm and manipulative, coordinated perception-building.Author Credibility: Evaluate content creators through a custom "Credibility Score" based on historical performance and editing behavior.🛠️ Technical Methodology1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & NLPSentiment Analysis: Used the vaderSentiment library to calculate sentiment scores for post titles to capture emotional extremes.Language Mapping: Generated WordClouds for "Controversial" posts to visualize the dominance of specific "meme stocks" (e.g., GME, AMC) and hype terms (e.g., "moon", "short squeeze").2. Custom Feature EngineeringHype Score: Developed a unique metric by combining sentiment intensity, frequency of hype-loaded keywords, and community trust (upvote ratio).Author Credibility: Calculated a score (0-100) for users by analyzing their average post score, post frequency, and "edit tendency".Logarithmic Transformation: Applied a $log(1+x)$ transformation to the target variable (score) to normalize the long-tailed distribution of Reddit engagement.3. Machine Learning ModelingThree regression models were trained and compared for engagement prediction:| Model | $R^2$ Score | Mean Absolute Error (MAE) || :--- | :--- | :--- || Linear Regression | 0.4965 | 0.8453 || Random Forest | 0.7589 | 0.5962 || XGBoost (Best Performer) | 0.7620 | 0.5931 |For hype risk classification, a Random Forest Classifier achieved an overall accuracy of 84.45%.📈 Key InsightsImmunity System: Analysis revealed that posts containing 3 or more "hype" keywords experienced an average drop in community trust (upvote ratio) of 2.7% to 3.6%.Content Focus: Despite the prevalence of hype language, the community shows a strong orientation toward technical analysis ("DD" or Due Diligence), suggesting that hype words alone do not guarantee trust.💻 Tech StackProgramming: PythonData Handling: Pandas, NumPy, BigQueryVisualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloudMachine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoostNLP: VADER Sentiment Analysis📁 Directory Structure/notebooks: Detailed Jupyter Notebooks covering EDA, feature engineering, and modeling./models: Pre-trained models saved in .pkl format for deployment./images: Visualizations, including the Confusion Matrix and Feature Importance charts.About MeI am a Data Analyst candidate with a background in education. I specialize in using Python for data analysis and am currently developing projects in the fields of financial data and Educational Technology (EdTech). I am particularly interested in building data-driven solutions that bridge the gap between technical analysis and user behavior.
